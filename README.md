# Image Generation Models Sandbox

Sandbox for implementing, experimenting, and testing different classes of image generation models. Implementations may be simplified or incomplete to better understand core ideas and trade-offs.

## Model Families

The following broad families of generative models are explored:

- adversarial 
- diffusion-based 
- autoregressive 
- variational 
- flow-based
